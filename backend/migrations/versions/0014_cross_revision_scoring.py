Revision ID: 0014_cross_revision_scoring
Revises: 0013_human_scoring

Superseded by the destructive M0 reset (0018_m0_question_library). The legacy
business schema this step built no longer exists in code or contract; the step
is kept as a revision marker only so databases stamped at intermediate heads
still converge through ``alembic upgrade head``.
