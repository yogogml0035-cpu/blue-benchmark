Revision ID: 0006_authoring_conversations
Revises: 0005_evaluation_versioning

Superseded by the destructive M0 reset (0018_m0_question_library). The legacy
business schema this step built no longer exists in code or contract; the step
is kept as a revision marker only so databases stamped at intermediate heads
still converge through ``alembic upgrade head``.
